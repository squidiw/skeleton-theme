# Skeleton Theme

A barebones ☠️ starter theme.

## System requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with Skeleton theme:

- **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- **pnpm** This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a packages manager.

- **Shopify CLI for themes:** To learn how to install Shopify CLI on Windows, macOS, or Linux, refer to [Install Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/install).

## Getting started

To start with Skeleton Theme, configure the `store` parameter in `package.json`. Then run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ pnpm dev
```

For more information on connecting your new project with a Shopify store, see the [Shopify CLI docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/getting-started/create#step-3-start-a-local-development-server).
